            "source": "London is home to the West End, one of the most famous theatre districts in the world. Every year, it shows and premieres lots of musicals and plays. Recent success stories include the play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and Six the Musical. According to uktheatre.org, in 2018, London's West End theatres drew in audiences totaling over 15.5m last year, resulting in box office revenue of over \u00a3765m \u2013 both record figures, generating over \u00a3127m in VAT for the Treasury. It is also a big drawing factor for tourists who visit London each year.\n\nSince March 2020, the theatres in the West End all had to close due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is having a detrimental affect on the theatre and entertaiment industry, with ticket sales dropping by 92% (ref - https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/19/uk-theatre-ticket-sales-drop-92-percent-due-to-covid-19). As theatres have hundreds of audience seats in close proximity to each other (i.e. a hotbed for spreading Covid-19), it looks like it will be some time before theatres will be able to reopen.\n\nDue to social distancing restrictions (people from different households must stay 2m apart), it's likely that when theatres do reopen, they will have to function differently to how they did previously, selling less seats per show so that social distancing can take place. This will undoubtedly cause a further loss in revenue for the theatres.\n\nWith the West End (and shows in general) being such a cultural asset to London and draw to tourists (another industry (tourism) that has suffered because of Covid-19 and social distancing requirements), it is really important that the theatres survive the pandemic, particularly as many people watch shows as a way to unwind and cope with stress. A likely outcome will be that ticket prices will increase due to less seats being sold per show. Therefore, it's really important for theatres to choose and advertise shows that they think will draw customers to buy tickets at an increased price.\n\nThe target audience for this study will be theatre owners who are looking to see what shows they should look at opening to bring back customers following the pandemic. They should be able to apply my model to any city."
